# Becoming a Web Developer; a Quest
(last updated june 2022) - [[Tjerk Dijkstra]]

"Everybody’s a web designer until, you know, they actually try to do it." - GABE BONING

Adventurer, welcome to the magic realm of web-development. There are many ways to learn and many languages and frameworks to explore. In this quest we are going to focus on starting somewhere and finding challenges along the way. If you already know the basics, do them again. If you are completely new, don't be to hard on yourself, small steps at a time.

### You need resilience to be a good programmer

Initially you need resilience because you're learning a new language, and that’s tough – we set a lot of pressure on ourselves to be able to write code quickly, but if you were learning a language such as French you wouldn’t expect to be able to speak it smoothly after seven days, or even seven weeks. 

But even once you’re past the learning stages, about once a month you'll hit a bug so bad or a problem so big you'll think you made the wrong career choice, and that you’re just not cut out for this coding thing. This is a bit like impostor syndrome, where you feel like everyone else would totally understand what’s going on, but you’re just not good enough. Usually what happens is that you fix the problem – which will sometimes be as simple as adding a single semi-colon, or flipping a plus sign to a minus – and suddenly all is right in the world again, and you’re back to thinking coding is awesome.

Your inventory should consist of:

- A basic code editor like Visual Studio Code or Atom
- A webbrowser with developer tools (Firefox, Chrome, Safari)
- A focused state of mind, take your time and remove distractions.
- A friend or a peer which you can tackle these quests with.

Your timeline for learning should go a bit like this:

HTML -> CSS -> Javascript -> Frameworks -> Back-end -> Dev Ops

Alright, good to go? Lets start with Quest 1.

# Quest 1: Learn the basics
## HTML
A simple markup language, you need to know:
